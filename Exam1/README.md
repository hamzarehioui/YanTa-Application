# Contact Manager GUI

## Concerned Courses
This project was developed in parallel with the following course as the *term-project*:
* **CSC311:** Software Engineering II

The graphical user interface portrays a Note Taking Interface, and while the rest of the project is still not implemented (folders, shared notes...), the main point is to show purpose and intent.

## Introduction
This note-taking application was made using the concepts of Software Engineering II in C#. Minimal and fairly simple code is written in the GUI *(WinForms Designer was used)*. This project was designed as the term-project during the course "**Software Engineering II CSC311**".
